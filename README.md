In this repository I write the code to make QR Code.
also here I tried to add color in QR_Code for the same.
we can create any QR_Code like our Phonepe, Paytm, or also website or channel code. 
so when you save that QR_Code in your device and that QR_Code if you want to share to your friends,family or coustomer you can share that code easily.  

In this code, we use the qrcode library to generate the QR code and the PIL (Pillow) library to customize the QR code's colors. You can replace the data variable with your own URL, text, or any data you want to encode in the QR code. The background_color and foreground_color parameters allow you to customize the colors of the QR code.

Simply run this script, and it will generate and display a color QR code for the provided data. You can then save the QR code image and share it as needed.

* Objectives:-

In this example, the QR code's purpose is to provide a convenient way for users to access a specific website (e.g., "https://example.com"). When someone scans this QR code, they will be directed to the website associated with the QR code. This can be useful for marketing, promotions, or sharing information with others efficiently.
